# Hot-Pink-Virtual-Tours-CSS-test03

 A Virtual tour website for a company called Hot Pink Virtual Tours. 
 In this version I spent some time customizing the CSS.


 Additions

- Dark Mode without JS
- Redesigned the layout of entire site so more important information is on the front page.
- Fixed and stylized external links and phone number links.
- Changed to a *potentially worse* teal/pink design and rounded corner buttons with some beginner CSS “art” on the <legends> and the main h1 logo in <header>
- Improved scaling withing different sized browsers with % values instead of px values for font sizing and img
- Better buttons
- Unified CSS "art" a bit more



Known Issues

- Most navigation <buttons> lead to a 404 page because those pages don’t exist yet.
- CSS “art” around <legends> display’s differently depending on the browser.


Future plans

- Dark Mode using JS
- Update hitboxes on <button> and <details>
- Fix how .legend {} css "art" appears on chrome. It is too tall right now.
- Add some js to buttons so they change color when you click and change back when you let go
- Pic with title to make it show up on tabs
