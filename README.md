# Hot-Pink-Virtual-Tours-CSS-test03

 A Virtual tour website for a company called Hot Pink Virtual Tours. 
 In this version I spent some time customizing the CSS.


 Additions

- Redesigned the layout of entire site so more important information is on the front page.
- Fixed and stylized external links and phone number links.
- Changed to a *potentially worse* teal/pink design and rounded corner buttons with some beginner CSS “art” on the <legends> and the main h1 logo in <header>


Known Issues

- Navigation <buttons> lead to a 404 page because those pages don’t exist yet.
- CSS “art” around <legends> display’s differently depending on the browser.


Future plans

- Dark Mode using a button and class="dark-mode" to change things to a black and pink theme
